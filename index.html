                    <h4 class="display-4 left">Objectives</h4>
                    <p> Training machine learning models that perform well has become increasingly easier. 
                        However, there is a lot more to take into account when attempting to do so, than just fitting them and predicting. In this project
                        we deal with a dataset that will pose problems for classic classifiers (and surely for much more sofisticated ones as well), 
                        with the aim of explaining why these methods don't work as well as we'd like. As a main takeaway is the idea that understanding the data,
                        what problem are we trying to solve, and which methods are adequate for the task, is paramount before engaging in ML modeling. Failure to
                        understand this could mean executing algorithms that take several hours to run in exchange for very low performance in terms both of results
                        and computational efficiency, or even trying and failing repeatedly to solve a problem that is actually unsolvable with the available data.  
                    </p>  
                    <h4 class="display-4 left">Summary</h4>
                    <p> We will use data from more than 70,000 beer recipes, which are segmented in 176 different styles. Beer styles will be our labels for 
                        classification, and we will deal with 2 subsets of the data: the first one will contain beer styles that amount for at least 0.5% of
                        total samples, and the second one will contain only the 2 most popular beer styles, making the classification task much simpler. The first 
                        dataset could be considered to be "complex" due to the high number of labels and high number of observations. Nonetheless, it should be
                        considered instead as "insufficient" data. In order to classify a large number of classes, it is not enough to have large samples of course,
                        but also a sufficient number of features (variables that describe each observation) that help distinguish classes between themselves, and hence
                        these must also be informative. In other words, the information in the data must contain enough different patterns so that ML methods can actually 
                        recognize them. This is difficult to know formally before testing any algorithm, but we should have an intuition to roughly identify datasets that will cause
                        problems. This is the case with our dataset and we will explain why later on. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>     
                        First, we have an exploratory data analysis to understand the data, and then we show the difference between both datasets 
                        with hyperparameter optimization methods to have the best fit possible on the classifiers, as proof that often data is the problem instead
                        of the model.

                    <p>The original data contains 73,861 observations (beer recipes) with 21 features (characteristics of the observations) segmented 
                        in 176 classes (beer styles). From this data we will make two subsets. Dataset-1 will be selected by keeping only the classes that represent at least
                        0.5% of data (in order to be able to stratify in the cross-validation methods) and Dataset-2 will be selected by keeping only the two largest classes.
                        Moreover, we apply a filter on the selected classes on the 'Sugar Scale' variable to keep only the larger class in this feature, since it is highly 
                        unbalanced. After selecting the data and applying the filter, we have 53,753 observations and 47 classes in Dataset-1 and 18,405 observations and 2 
                        classes for Dataset-2.

                    </p>
            
                    <p> To clean the data, we simply dropped the columns (features) that had too many missing values or that were irrelevant for the classification 
                        task. For example, the amount of beer made in the recipe tells us no information about what the style the recipe belongs to. The rows
                        with missing values after keeping the most relevant features were dropped as well. The reason for not imputing is that we are interested 
                        in using this data for experimentation on machine learning modeling, rather than trying to extract patterns for a practical application. 
                        Also, Gravity and Final Gravity are highly correlated, so one of them was dropped.
                             
                    </p>
            
                    <p> A good way of understanding the intricacies of the beer styles represented in the recipe samples, is the following dendrogram, since it
                        provides a way of quickly visualizing similarity between beer styles of interest. This was made by taking the beer styles as vectors
                        on euclidean space described by the mean of the feature corresponding to each entry. Then, single-linkage hierarchical clustering,
                        with euclidean metrics was applied.

                    <p> To show the difficulty of this classification task, due to the fact that there is simply not much data to help distinguish between classes, 
                        we illustrate the overlap between the Dataset-2 (binary) classes on the features that were kept with their pairwise (2D) projections.

                    <p> Moreover, we show how similar distributions between classes are when it comes to variables that usually makes beer styles somewhat 
                        different for the consumer: alcohol content and color.

                          that at some stage it becomes pointless to try and apply more complex machine learning models to the problem at hand.
