# Complex vs Insufficient Data

An experiment to see how far can model complexity help when data for classification (in this case, the beer-recipe dataset) is not separable enough to distinguish among multiple classes. Spoiler: not much. Summary of the experiment can be found at https://sctueme.github.io/ML-data-exp/  

The EDA notebook outputs a csv file to be used for the machine learning section.
